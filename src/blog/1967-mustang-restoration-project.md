I have been restoring a 1967 Mustang Coupe with my father over the years, as time and life allows. This post will be updated as the build progresses.

## Purchase

This specimen came from the factory with a bench seat, inline 6, and automatic transmission.

## Cleanup

The car was sitting in a field for some time, so an initial cleaning with a pressure washer helped remove wasp nests, mud, and any other loose debris.

## Teardown

The floor pans were rusted through, and the hood, deck lid, fenders, and quarter panels all had their share of oxidation.

## Rust removal &amp; priming

The whole car was media blasted (with pecan shells, actually), and any metal that was too far gone was cut away. Rust-prone and tough-to-reach spots were covered in <a href="http://www.rustbullet.com/">Rust Bullet</a> (a rust inhibitor) for future protection, and the entire car was sprayed with primer.

## Engine Build

I was fortunate to build the engine for this car with my grandfather before he passed away. It's a Ford 302 V8 bored .30 over, with Trick Flow heads and intake manifold, and a decent set of headers.
