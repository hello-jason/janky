    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Located on Loyola University's campus, the Holy Name of Jesus church dates to the 1800s. They requested a new website with manageable content in order to provide updated information to parishioners.</p>
    <p>Another important goal was to create web forms for parish membership, ministry application, and tithing.</p>
