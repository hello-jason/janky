    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The P&S Surgical Hospital of Monroe needed a new public website to represent their evolving organization. The previous website and company representatives provided helpful feedback and content structure, allowing for a pleasant design and development process.</p>
    <p>The client requested WordPress, which would provide a comfortable platform for managing content. I designed and helped develop a responsive theme on the Roots framework, utilizing Pods (and other tools) to offer a small learning curve for managing their new website.</p>
