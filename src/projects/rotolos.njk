    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The growing Rotolo's Pizzeria corporation wanted to provide menu and catering information to customers while simultaneously guiding entrepreneurs to franchising details.</p>
    <p>I worked closely with designer <a href="https://mandyporta.com/">Mandy Porta</a> to develop a website that allows the Rotoloâ€™s marketing team to update news posts, menu items, and other content as needed while the brand continues to grow across the Gulf South.</p>
    <p>The site was developed onto WordPress using the Roots framework, offering a responsive layout and manageable codebase. Ongoing maintenance and consulting help their team keep the website updated.</p>
